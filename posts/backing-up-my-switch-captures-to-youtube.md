I finally got around to organizing all my Nintendo Switch video captures and uploaded them to a YouTube playlist. The main reason? The SD card just had so many video files on it lol

Instead of letting the clips sit there eating up space, I figured I'd back them up online so I can delete them from the Switch and free up some room. Now I’ve got one big playlist where I can look back at my moments—or cringe at them 😬—whenever I want.

You can check out the playlist here:

I’ll probably keep adding more over time. If you’re curious what I’ve been playing or just want to see some random in-game highlights, feel free to watch!
