I've added a **Splatfest Frames** page, a dedicated tool for merging Splatoon-themed frames with your avatar! All frames are created by [GabsJpeg](https://twitter.com/GabsJpeg) and [Kas_L05](https://twitter.com/Kas_L05), this tool lets you rep your favorite Splatfest teams in style.

### How to get splatfest frame:
1. **Upload** a square avatar image (PNG/JPG).
2. **Select** from a variety of **frames**—Octopus 🐙 or Squid 🦑 styles included.
3. **Preview** and **download** your custom image instantly!
