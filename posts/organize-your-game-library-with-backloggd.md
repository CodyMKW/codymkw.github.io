Not sponsored or anything, but I randomly found this website called [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/) that lets you organize all your games. You can track what you've played, rate and review them, and even make lists. It's kind of like Letterboxd, but for video games.

If you're the type of person who likes keeping track of your gaming backlog or just wants to see what you've completed over time, it's pretty cool. Plus, seeing other people's reviews can be fun, especially if you're looking for recommendations.

Might start using it myself to log everything I've played! You can check out my profile here: [CodyMKW on Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/u/CodyMKW/).
