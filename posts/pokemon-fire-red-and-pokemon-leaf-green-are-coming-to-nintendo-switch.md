Looks like Pokémon Fire Red and Pokémon Leaf Green are coming to the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 after the Pokemon Day Presents presentation which begins Friday, February 27, 2026, at 6AM PST.

I'll  definitely add Leaf Green to my eShop wishlist and pick it up eventually just to replay it on official hardware I'd rather spend $20 on these old GBA games then buy pointless 4K upgraded games that are unappealing and not fun to play at all anyway below is the video posted by the Official Pokemon youtube account!
