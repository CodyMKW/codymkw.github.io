I've added a new page to my website that lets you watch Twitch streams without all the extra lag from the main Twitch site! 

## What is it?
This new page is a **lightweight Twitch stream viewer** where you can enter a Twitch username, and it'll load the stream **without chat** or any unnecessary UI elements. This should make it a much smoother experience, especially if the main Twitch website feels sluggish.

## Why did I make this?
Twitch can be **laggy** at times, and I just wanted a simpler way to watch streams without all the extra stuff. If you're looking for a **minimalist** way to watch your favorite streamers, give it a try!
