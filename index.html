      I'm Cody, a 32-year-old Nintendo fan and Animal Crossing enthusiast.
      I've been playing Animal Crossing since the original game on the GameCube,
      and I've been hooked ever since. I love the peaceful and relaxing atmosphere
      of the game, and I enjoy the sense of community that comes from playing with
      friends and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      My other favorite Nintendo games include Mario Kart, Splatoon, and the
      Legend of Zelda series. I'm also a big fan of anime, and my favorite series
      is Clannad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm passionate about Nintendo, and I'm always looking for new ways to
      experience their games. I'm also a big fan of the Nintendo community.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm excited to see what the future holds for Nintendo. I'm confident that
      they will continue to create amazing games that will bring people together.
