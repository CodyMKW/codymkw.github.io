      <p>
        I'm Cody, a 32-year-old Nintendo fan and Animal Crossing enthusiast.
        I've been playing Animal Crossing since the original game on the GameCube,
        and I've been hooked ever since. I love the peaceful and relaxing atmosphere
        of the game, and I enjoy the sense of community that comes from playing with
        friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        My other favorite Nintendo games include Mario Kart, Splatoon, and the
        Legend of Zelda series. I'm also a big fan of anime, and my favorite series
        is Clannad.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about Nintendo, and I'm always looking for new ways to
        experience their games. I'm also a big fan of the Nintendo community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm excited to see what the future holds for Nintendo. I'm confident that
        they will continue to create amazing games that will bring people together.
