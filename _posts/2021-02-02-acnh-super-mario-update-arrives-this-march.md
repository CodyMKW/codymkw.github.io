Nintendo has issued a reminder via social media that the next big update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons on the Switch will be arriving next month. _Yay!_

While no specific release date has been shared just yet, we do know this update will be Super Mario themed. This lines up with Mario's 35th-anniversary celebrations, which will seemingly come to a close on 31st March this year.

This update was first announced [during Nintendo's Super Mario 35th anniversary Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_UcjEq2Dgk&feature=youtu.be) last September. During this event, it was also revealed how "Super Mario themed furniture" would be added to the Switch version of Animal Crossing.
