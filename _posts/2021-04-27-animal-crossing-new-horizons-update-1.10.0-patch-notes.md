The seasonal events May Day, Museum Day and Wedding Season have all been updated and there are also new seasonal items available. Bug Offs and Fishing Tourneys return, too. Perhaps the highlight is the ability to wake up from dreams at any moment, by pressing the (–) button on the controller.

Along with this are some fixes, various other adjustments, and "corrections" to further improve the gameplay experience. Here are the full patch notes, courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:
