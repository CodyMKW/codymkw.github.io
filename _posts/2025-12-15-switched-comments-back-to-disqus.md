I'm so indecisive lol. Anyway, I decided to switch back to Disqus for the blog comments, so you no longer need to make a GitHub account—just comment as a guest or use a Disqus account. Guest comments do have to be approved first. The theme of the comments may not change when you switch the site theme the first time you click the theme toggle button; just click it again and it should change the comment theme! :)
