Nintendo has been very active with the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack retro libraries recently. Although it varies which retro library gets updated with some more games, as well as exactly how many, Nintendo’s schedule of additional games has reached a point where it is now guaranteed to see at least one retro game added a month.

 Well, it isn’t surprising, but tonight has proved to be no exception. You see, Nintendo has announced that Fatal Fury 2, Super Ninja Boy, and Sutte Hakkun are now available to play for Nintendo Switch Online members. It can be found in the SNES retro library.
