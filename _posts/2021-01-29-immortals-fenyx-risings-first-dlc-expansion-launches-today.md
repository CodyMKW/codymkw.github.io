Back in November, Ubisoft confirmed it was planning [post-launch DLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVVWOuug7E8&feature=emb_title) for Immortals Fenyx Rising. So far, that's given us cosmetic crossovers between [Blood of Zeus](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/1WyB9gLSchajIuTGLp72Ho/immortals-fenyx-rising-teams-up-with-neflixs-blood-of-zeus) and **[Adventure Time](https://youtu.be/qaoDFnTLeWg)**, but we'd been waiting on the first story expansion, "A New God".

Having initially been listed for January 21st, it's available now on the Switch eShop. Taking place after the main story's conclusion, A New God will allow us to explore Olympos Palace, and Ubisoft outlined just what you can expect within this statement:

> Immortals Fenyx Rising's first DLC, Immortals Fenyx Rising: A New God, is available on all platforms on January 28 and tasks Fenyx with overcoming the Trials of the Olympians to take their rightful place in the Greek pantheon.
>
> A New God will allow players to explore Olympos Palace and interact with new gameplay mechanics as they traverse the new trials built by the gods. Along the way, players will unlock four surprising new ability upgrades for Fenyx and a new gear set with fantastic perks fit for a god such as letting you perform additional jumps.

Out of the three DLC episodes, A New God is the only one that'll focus on Fenyx, as "Myths Of The Eastern Realm" and "The Lost Gods" are introducing us to new protagonists. Presently, their release dates remain unconfirmed and though their previous eShop listing suggested February 25th and April 1st respectively, this has since been updated to "2021".

A New God is now available for $14.99, alongside a Season Pass covering all three episodes for $39.99. If you've not picked up Immortals yet but were interested in it, a [demo was made available](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/immortals-fenyx-rising-switch/) recently too, so why not take a look?
