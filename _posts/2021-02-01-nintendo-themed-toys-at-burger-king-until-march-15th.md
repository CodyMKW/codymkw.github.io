From today, you can get your hands on some Nintendo-themed toys from participating Burger King stores in North America. From a ‘Metal Mario’ Kart, to the iconic green squid from Splatoon, there’s a total of six toys available from a King Jr Meal. Nintendo and Burger King are also offering folk the chance to win a Nintendo Switch console and a copy of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury (dubbed the Nintendo Switch Prize Pack) if they order through the BK app or online at BK.com. Here’s the full announcement from Nintendo PR about the promotional event:

Whether you’re hard at work creating new courses with Builder Mario or hunting ghosts with Luigi, you’re bound to work up a powerful appetite. Well, there’s good news! In addition to delicious food, your child’s next King Jr Meal from a Burger King restaurant will include a fun Nintendo surprise!

Beginning Feb. 1 and running through March 15, King Jr Meals at participating Burger King locations across the U.S., Canada and parts of Latin America* will include one of six different toys inspired by Nintendo Switch games. Toys will feature signature characters from games such as Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Luigi’s Mansion 3, Super Mario Maker 2, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening and Splatoon 2. In celebration of the launch of the Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury game on Feb. 12, Burger King is also offering families and kids in the continental U.S. a chance to win a Nintendo Switch Prize Pack that includes the game along with a Nintendo Switch system!

In Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury, you’ll be able to play with friends and family through dozens of colorful stages in which Mario and his friends can use power-ups like the Super Bell, which grants catlike abilities, as you work together to defeat Bowser. In the new Bowser’s Fury adventure, Mario is confronted with a rampaging Bowser. You’ll join forces with Bowser Jr. to venture through an interconnected world made of cat-themed … well, everything! While Mario has had a longtime rivalry with Bowser, king of the Koopas, Nintendo’s partnership with the king of burgers is sure to be a royally fun occasion for all.

When you purchase a Super Mario Meal on the BK Mobile App or online at BK.com between Feb. 8 and Feb. 22, you’ll be entered for a chance to win a Nintendo Switch Prize Pack, which includes a Nintendo Switch system and the Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury game. The Super Mario Meal at Burger King consists of the Whopper sandwich, small fries and small fountain drink. Even if your Super Mario Meal doesn’t earn you the Nintendo Switch prize pack, you’ll still be able to receive 100 My Nintendo Platinum Points with your purchase of a Super Mario Meal between Feb. 8 and Feb. 22, while supplies last. My Nintendo members can pounce on these Platinum Points and redeem them for exclusive rewards.

“Nintendo has always had a mission of delivering smiles to families, and we’re delighted to work with Burger King to deliver smiles through our partnership together,” said Nick Chavez, Nintendo of America’s Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing. “Whether families are ringing Mario’s Super Bell power-up or they simply want to ring the dinner bell in style, we hope everyone can look forward to some king-sized Nintendo fun at Burger King.”
