The Pokémon franchise is no stranger to augmented reality – Pokémon GO uses the tech to put hundreds of monsters in your living room, and even the 3DS had Pokémon Dream Radar, another game that had you capturing Pokémon in a real-life setting – but one fan has put their own spin on the formula.

YouTuber user Fyone has created a concept for an augmented reality take on the Pokémon Trading Card Game. Using the Unity 3D game engine with AR software development kit, Vuforia, Fyone has managed to create a 'game' which reads real-life Pokémon cards, creates fully-animated models of the selected Pokémon, and even plays out battles as you select your commands.

Only Pikachu and Machamp have been given the AR treatment – naturally, this kind of work takes a lot of time – but it's pretty impressive nonetheless and actually makes use of Pokémon Sword and Shield's UI styling to finish the look. You can see how it all came together in the video below (the finished product can be seen in action from the 7:29 mark):
