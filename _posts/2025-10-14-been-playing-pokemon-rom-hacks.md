![Been playing Pokemon rom hacks!](https://i.imgur.com/HMT9q3Z.png)

I've been playing some Pokemon romhacks on my 3ds mainly one called Pokemon Unbound and that romhack is very impressive almost feels like a game that Game Freak would create it's very polished for a romhack having fun with it so far.

If anyone wants to play it get the patch file from [here](https://www.pokecommunity.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-unbound-completed.382178/) you obviously need to provide your own rom to apply it 😅
