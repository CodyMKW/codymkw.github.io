![Huge ACNH Free 3.0 Update!](https://files.catbox.moe/7aaue5.png)

Nintendo finally revealed the free 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons coming in January, and it’s honestly a pretty huge one. Here’s a clear list of everything that’s being added and what each thing actually does:

- **Resort Hotel** – A new building on the pier ran by the Kapp'n family where you get to decorate different themed rooms. Characters will visit the hotel and you can customize their rooms, kind of like a smaller, built-in version of Happy Home Paradise.

- **Slumber Island** – If you have Nintendo Switch Online, you can create up to **three extra islands** that are totally separate from your main one. It’s basically extra creative space where you can test designs, make themed islands, or just mess around without touching your real island.

- **Massive storage upgrade** – Your home storage jumps all the way up to **9,000 items**, which is almost double the old cap. You can also store **trees, shrubs, and flowers**, which makes organizing your island way easier and keeps your pockets from being a disaster.

- **New furniture sets** – Includes a bunch of new themed items like LEGO-style furniture and other collab sets. Good for people who love interior decorating or making themed rooms.

- **New villagers** – Some new characters can move in if you have certain amiibo (from series like Zelda or Splatoon). Nice extra incentive for collectors.

- **Bulk crafting** – Lets you craft multiple items at once instead of hammering the A button like a maniac.

- **Resetti’s Cleanup Service** – A new feature where Resetti can help clean up stuff around your island if things have gotten messy or you want to reset an area faster.

Overall this is easily the biggest free update the game’s had in years, and it honestly feels like they’re trying to bring players back in a big way. I’m definitely ready for January to roll around.
