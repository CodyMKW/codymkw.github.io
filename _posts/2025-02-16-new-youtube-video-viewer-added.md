![New YouTube Video Viewer Added!](https://i.imgur.com/rOUSo3S.png)

I've added a new page to my website that lets you watch YouTube videos without all the extra distractions from the main site! 

## Why did I make this?
Well, I already had a **Twitch stream viewer**, so why not a YouTube one? This makes it easy to watch videos without getting sucked into the YouTube rabbit hole. Plus, it supports **multiple videos at once**, so you can queue up content just the way you like!

## Features
- **Minimalist Video Viewing**: No distractions, just the video
- **Multi-Video Support**: Enter multiple video IDs to watch more than one at a time
- **Shareable URLs**: Your video selections stay in the address bar
- **Easy Close Buttons**: Remove any video without affecting others
