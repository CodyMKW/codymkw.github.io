![Multi-Stream Viewer Update! Watch Multiple Twitch Streams at Once](https://i.imgur.com/wRNXB5M.png)

I've updated my Twitch viewer page with **multi-stream capabilities**! Now you can watch multiple streams simultaneously!

## What's New?
- **Multi-Stream View**: Enter comma-separated usernames to create your own custom stream grid
- **Individual Close Buttons**: Remove specific streams without affecting others
- **Persistent Layout**: Add new streams without reloading existing ones
- **Shareable URLs**: Your stream combination stays in the address bar

## How it works
1. Enter usernames separated by commas (e.g.: `user1, user2, user3`)
2. Streams arrange automatically in a responsive grid
3. Click the red X to remove any stream
4. Add more streams anytime without reloading!
