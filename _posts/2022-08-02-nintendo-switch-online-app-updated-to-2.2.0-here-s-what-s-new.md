Nintendo has released a new update for the Switch Online mobile application, designed for use with Android and iOS devices.

There's no mention of stability improvements or anything like that, but there have been some noticeable improvements to friend request features. Users can now send friend quests using a friend code, and copy a URL or use a QR to send a friend request.

Apart from this, some other "minor changes" have been added to the Switch Online app. For Apple users, this app can now only run on iOS devices that are updated to iOS 14.0 or above. Here are the full patch notes for Version 2.2.0:

* You can now send friend requests using your friend code. (Accepting a friend request requires a Nintendo Switch console.)
* You are now able to copy your friend code as a URL and/or save it as a QR code, which others can then use to send you friend requests.
* Other minor changes have also been implemented.
* System requirements have been updated to iOS 14.0
