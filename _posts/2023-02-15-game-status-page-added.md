I have added the [Game Status page](/game-status) this page will show the what game I'm playing on my Nintendo Switch in real time. Huge thanks to [Samuel Elliott](https://mastodon.fancy.org.uk/@samuel) for creating [nxapi](https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/nxapi) without it this page wouldn't work! :)
